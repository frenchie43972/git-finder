This project was a result of a Udemy course 'React Front to Back' by
Brad Traversy. I used this as an opportunity to:

1. Learn React a little more in-depth
2. Take my time and look up what was going on in the code. As well
taught the course is, it did not cover everything. There were some things assumed by Brad that the students should know beforehand and
I most liekly did not understand those concepts.
3. Make some instructional code comments for me to use on other projects int the future.

Some areas will not have any comments. This is because it would have 
been covered somewhere else in the application and I do not want to
double document my work. For example, GithubContext and GithubReducer
are commented well, so I did not ad anything to AlertContext and Reducer.

Also, some files have no comments, because I felt that they were just
not necessary.

The styling in this project is all from Brad and his team. I have yet
to dive deeply into CSS or CSS frameworks.

Here is the finished product: https://git-finder-lake.vercel.app/
